<h2> Authors and Books </h2>
<h3> Humans that write any kinds of "books" we read are called "authors"</h3>
<p> While we dont appreciate them well enough by not reading enough books if its not academically based , people that actually 
appreciate authors are called bookworms.Note that "bookworms" are not always bulky readers , they could be  people that pick just a book to read a month , read 50 books in a month as long as they are all appreciating authors by reading their books and the genre they read doesnt matter.
