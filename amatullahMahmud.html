<title> AUTHORS. </title> 
<body>
 <h2> Humans that write any kinds of books we read are called authors.</h2>
<p> While we dont appreciate them well enough by not reading enough books if its not academically based , people that actually 
appreciate authors are called bookworms.Note that "bookworms" are not always bulky readers , they could be  people that pick just a book to read a month , read 50 books in a month as long as they are all appreciating authors by reading their books and the genre they read doesnt matter.
